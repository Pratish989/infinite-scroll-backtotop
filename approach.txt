// Approach 1
// make only 9 divs on one page
// when user scroll it shows the loader animaition
// next 9divs should be visible/shown
// now when the user scrolls up the divs above the current page is visible
// meaning there are only 9 divs and all the items that are coming should get updated

//issue here -> when user wants to scroll up fast to the page 1 then it should go fast rather than loading the animation(loader)


// Approach 2
// make a main div(item) container
// the items that are visible right now at the screen will be ther updated at the dom

// issue here-> when user want to scroll up then how fast the dom has to be updated. items will dynamically be added on the DOM.
